# Cypress-Automation-Framework

This is a self learning process in which I choose to test https://automationteststore.com/ web site using Cypress.   
In this project you can find e2e folder where I write the test with the Page Object Models that can be found in support folder along with the handler I made to login.
I use Page Object Model to reduce code duplication and improve test case maintenance.
